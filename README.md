# NGSDiffGeo
This is an add-on package to NGSolve for differential geometry support. We focus on Riemannian manifolds. Examples and tutorials can be found in the [documentation](https://michaelneunteufel.github.io/NGSDiffGeo/).


We gratefully acknowledge support by the Austrian Science Foundation [FWF][1] within project grant [J4824 Numerical analysis of curvatures from Regge finite elements][2].
