    "## History of Regge elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $(M,g)$ be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold with $M\\subset\\mathbb{R}^N$ and $g$ the metric tensor with signature ++++ (positive definite in the Riemannian case) or -+++ (pseudo-Riemannian manifold). After discretizing the manifold's domain $M$ by a simplicial triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ (e.g., triangles in 2D and tetrahedra in 3D), we need to construct an approximation of the metric tensor $g$ on this triangulation. It will turn out that the Regge finite element space is the correct object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first intuitive way to approximate $g$ on $\\mathcal{T}$ is to assign to each edge $E_{ij}$, connecting two distinguished points $x_i$ and $x_j$ of the triangulation, its squared lengths $l^2_{ij}$ as measured by the metric $g$, i.e.\n",

    "l^2_{ij}= \\int_{E_{ij}}g(t_{E_{ij}},t_{E_{ij}})\\,ds,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "where $t_{E_{ij}}$ denotes the unit tangent vector of the edge $E_{ij}$. Using the squared value, we can use negative numbers to account for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds appearing in general relativity. One may hope that this procedure yields a good approximation of the exact metric for a sequence of finer triangulations. With this idea Tullio Regge proposed in [<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF02733251\">Regge. General relativity without coordinates. <i>Il Nuovo Cimento</i>, (1961).</a>] a method to solve numerical relativity in a coordinate-free way. From the edge lengths, he computed the angle defect (also called angle deficit) to approximate the curvature of the manifold. We will intensively discuss the concept of angle defect in the following notebooks. This method became popular under the name Regge calculus, see, e.g. [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06193\">Barret, Oriti, Wiliams. Tullio Regge’s legacy: Regge calculus\n",
    "and discrete gravity. <i>arXiv</i>, (2018).</a>] for a review of Regge calculus. The first proof that this concept of an angle defect converges to the exact curvature was given in [<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/BF01210729\">Cheeger, Müller, Schrader. On the curvature of piecewise flat spaces. <i>Communications in Mathematical Physics</i>, (1984).</a>] by proving convergence in the sense of measures.\n",

D</i>, (1975).</a>] that assigning length values is equivalent to defining a piecewise constant metric tensor: Let $l_{ij}^2$ denote the value of the edge connecting vertices $x_i$ and $x_j$, $i\\neq j$.

    "The above equation defines the metric $g_h$. Astonishingly, the metric $g_h$ is not completely discontinuous over element interfaces: Let $F$ be an $N-1$-dimensional facet of the triangulation and let $X,Y$ be two vector fields living in $F$, i.e. they are tangential vector fields on $F$, $X,Y\\in \\mathfrak{X}(F)$. Then the values $g_h(X,Y)$ measured by the piece-wise constant metric $g_h$ on the two elements $T_L$ and $T_R$ connected by $F= T_L\\cap T_R$ coincide\n",
